# Food Collab

An app to collaboratively order food. Every user can participate in
a food ordering and add the meals they want to order. It should
automatically calculate discounts. The administrator of the food
ordering can check off paid users.

## Technical Details

This is used as a test bed for iOS development in a TDD (or BDD)
fashion. I want to use the following things in the app:

  * Cocoapods
  * Frank with cucumber
  * Kiwi or OCUnit
  * ARC
  
## Backend

A backend should be used for persistence and push notifications (for
reminders or general events). I can think of using any of these:

  * Parse
  * helios
  * Azure
